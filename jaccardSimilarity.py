'''The Jaccard index, also known as Intersection over Union and the Jaccard similarity coefficient 
(originally given the French name coefficient de communaut√© by Paul Jaccard), is a statistic used 
for gauging the similarity and diversity of sample sets.'''

the jaccard similarity is (A intersect B /AUB).'''
